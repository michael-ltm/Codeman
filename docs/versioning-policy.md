# Versioning & Stability Policy

Codeman follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`),
managed via `@changesets/cli` (see the COM workflow in `CLAUDE.md`).

This document defines **what the version number actually promises** — i.e. which
surfaces are covered by SemVer and which are explicitly not. It exists because
"1.0" is a commitment to stability, and an undocumented public surface invites
incompatible client assumptions we would then be pressured to keep.

> **Status:** finalized for the 1.0 cut. The HTTP/SSE API **is** part of the stable
> surface — served under `/api/v1` with a uniform response envelope and
> conventional HTTP status codes. See [`api-reference.md`](api-reference.md).

## What SemVer covers (the public, stable surface)

A **MAJOR** bump is required to break any of these after 1.0:

1. **The CLI.** Command names, documented flags, and their behavior for
   `codeman <command>` (published to npm as `aicodeman`; invoked as `codeman`).
   This is the package's actual public entry point (`bin`).
   - The package is published to npm as `aicodeman` and installs **both** the
     `aicodeman` and `codeman` commands (`bin` aliases); `codeman` is the
     canonical command used throughout the docs. Renaming either after 1.0 is a
     breaking change.
2. **The published `xterm-zerolag-input` library**, but on **its own version
   line** — it is versioned and released independently of the Codeman app. Its
   1.0 status is a separate decision; the Codeman app reaching 1.0 does *not*
   imply `xterm-zerolag-input` is 1.0.
3. **Documented environment variables** that configure deployment:
   `CODEMAN_PASSWORD`, `CODEMAN_USERNAME`, `CODEMAN_HOST`, `CODEMAN_PORT`,
   `CODEMAN_INSTANCE`, `CODEMAN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CODEMAN_DATA_DIR`,
   `CODEMAN_TMUX_SOCKET`, and the `--host` / `--port` / `--https` CLI flags.
   Removing or changing the meaning of one of these is breaking.
4. **The HTTP API and SSE event channel**, served under **`/api/v1`** with the
   uniform `{success:true,data}` / `{success:false,error,errorCode}` envelope and
   conventional HTTP status codes. Endpoint paths, the response envelope, error
   `errorCode` values, and SSE event names are stable — see
   [`api-reference.md`](api-reference.md). *Additive* changes (new endpoints, new
   optional fields, new error codes, new SSE events) are non-breaking; breaking
   changes ship under a new prefix (`/api/v2`). The unversioned `/api/...` alias
   is kept working for the bundled UI.

## What SemVer does NOT cover (internal surfaces — may change in any release)

These may change in a **MINOR** (or even PATCH) release without a MAJOR bump:

1. **The `~/.codeman/` state file formats** (`state.json`, `settings.json`,
   `mux-sessions.json`, etc.). We make a **best-effort** to migrate existing data
   forward (and have done so across renames), but the on-disk schema is not a
   stable contract — do not write tooling that depends on its exact shape.
2. **Internal TypeScript modules.** The npm package is CLI-only; `import`ing it
   programmatically is not supported (there is no stable library entry point).
3. **Experimental / opt-in features**, regardless of the app's version:
   Gesture Control (beta), Agent Teams
   (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`), and anything labeled experimental
   in the UI or docs. These may change or be removed at any time.

## Deprecation policy

When we need to change a covered surface:

- Prefer **additive** changes (new flag/env var/command) over breaking ones.
- A covered surface slated for removal is **deprecated first** — it keeps working
  for at least one MINOR release with a runtime warning and a `CHANGELOG.md` note
  pointing to the replacement — then removed in the next MAJOR.
- Back-compat migration shims (e.g. the historical Claudeman→Codeman data/socket
  migration) are kept until a MAJOR boundary, then may be dropped.

## Pre-1.0 (`0.x`) caveat

Until 1.0 ships, **any release may contain breaking changes** per SemVer's `0.x`
allowance. The commitments above take effect at `1.0.0`.
