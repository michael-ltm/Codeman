# then LOG OUT and back in. Until you do, macOS keeps every window on a single
# display and this script's window will clamp to one monitor instead of spanning.
# (Equivalent CLI: `defaults write com.apple.spaces spans-displays -bool true`,
#  still needs a re-login. Revert with `-bool false`.)

# Why a maximized --app window and not fullscreen: browser fullscreen is
# per-display and will NOT span. We size a windowed app to the union of all
# displays instead. macOS only.
