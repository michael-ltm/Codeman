/**
 * @fileoverview Cross-session federated search types (COD-9).
 *
 * Defines the typed shapes for `GET /api/search` — a bounded, in-memory
 * federated search across three v1 sources: live sessions/cases, run-summary
 * timeline events, and per-session attachment file paths. Terminal-buffer scans
 * and any persisted index are explicitly out of scope for v1.
 *
 * Key exports:
 * - SearchSourceType — the federated source kinds, also the group order key.
 * - SearchResult — a single typed result card (source, session id/name,
 *   timestamp, snippet, jump-to action target).
 * - SearchJumpTarget — where the frontend should navigate when a card is opened.
 * - SearchResponseData — grouped result payload returned in the ApiResponse envelope.
 *
 * No I/O, no dependencies on other domain modules. The pure search core lives
 * in `src/search-service.ts`; the route wrapper in `src/web/routes/search-routes.ts`.
