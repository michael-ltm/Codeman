/**
 * @fileoverview Tool-related type definitions.
 *
 * Types for tracking Claude's tool invocations in real-time.
 *
 * Key exports:
 * - ActiveBashTool — a live bash command with extracted file paths and status
 * - ActiveBashToolStatus — 'running' | 'completed'
 * - ImageDetectedEvent — screenshot/image file detection trigger for UI popup
 * - AttachmentDetectedEvent — document/image file detection trigger for attachment cards
 *
 * Cross-domain relationships:
 * - ActiveBashTool.sessionId links to SessionState.id (session domain)
 * - ImageDetectedEvent.sessionId links to SessionState.id (session domain)
 *
 * Both types are in-memory only (not persisted). Broadcast via SSE events
 * `subagent:tool_call`, `image:detected`, and `attachment:detected`. Parsed by BashToolParser
 * (`src/bash-tool-parser.ts`).
